This course covers a broad range of basic statistical methods used in the health sciences. We will start with a review of descriptive statistics and introductory probability, then explore probability and sampling distributions, central limit theorem, and confidence intervals. These topics will be followed by basic hypothesis testing framework, along with the appropriate power and sample size considerations. We will also cover large-sample hypothesis tests for means, proportions and variances, and some exact tests. Students will be introduced to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation and simple linear regression in preparation for BSTA 512/612. Most homework assignments are to be completed using R.
