I am currently working as an Assistant Profess of Biostatistics at the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health.

**I strive to educate future biostatisticians and data scientists in responsible and thoughtful practice.** Most of my time is spent developing, improving, and teaching graduate-level biostatistics courses at OHSU. I create content in the classroom to improve accessibility for all students. 

**I work on research involving pragmatic trials, wearable device data, and statistics education.** I currently develop study designs for pragmatic trials, often in partnership with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN). My current project in wearable devices includes a statistical approach to deciding on the most appropriate time window for summarizing high-frequency data. My current statistics education project involves trauma- and resilience-informed practice guidelines.
