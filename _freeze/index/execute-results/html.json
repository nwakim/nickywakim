I create content in the classroom to improve accessibility for all students. \n\n**I work on research involving pragmatic trials, wearable device data, and statistics education.** I currently develop study designs for pragmatic trials, often in partnership with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN). My current project in wearable devices includes a statistical approach to deciding on the most appropriate time window for summarizing high-frequency data. My current statistics education project involves trauma- and resilience-informed practice guidelines. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
